= Ephemeral World Demo Scripts

This repository contains the setup guides and scripts for my presentation on
Ephemeral environments using https://www.osbuild.org/[Image Builder] and https://buildah.io/[buildah].

This demo and talk have been validated against the following host operating systems. Please 
feel free to provide a pull request or raise an issue if you've validated this with any additional
Linux flavours.

* https://fedoraproject.org[Fedora 35]
* https://redhat.com[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.x]
* https://redhat.com[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9] *_Beta_*

In line with the talks focus on ephemeral environments we'll leverage cloud ready
images for the OS that can be rapidly configured via Ansible to demo the
key technologies.

If you don't want to deploy your own environment Red Hat have a number of free to use lab and
learining environments we'll link too below.

== Deploy and Confiure a simple VM as used for the demo

If you want to try some of the demo code and need a configured Linux host here are some initial steps

- Deploy a link:docs/Demo_VM.adoc[local or cloud hosted linux environment]
- Then use link:docs/Demo_Setup.adoc[Ansible to install and configure buildah and Image Builder]

You should be able to connect to cockpit instance running on your demo VM on port 9090, eg

- https://192.168.124.138:9090

You can now

- try out link:docs/ImageBuilder.adoc[Image Builder]
- or link:docs/Buildah.adoc[buildah]

I've also supplied the link:keys/demo_key.pub[public] and link:keys/demo_key[private keys] we're using to SSH
into the generated OS Images

== Issues / Gotchas

=== Running out of space
The VM Images we're running are relatively small from a storage perspective so there is a chance
you'll run out of scratch space if you attempt to create very large images.


=== RHEL 9 Beta
At present the default install of RHEL 9 Beta attempts to use the production RHEL 9 content
repositories when building images. This issue is similar to the problem under.

* https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5773421

Currently the issue can be resolved by running the following on your RHEL9 VM

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -pv /etc/osbuild-composer/repositories

cp /usr/share/osbuild-composer/repositories/rhel-90.json /etc/osbuild-composer/repositories/rhel-90.json

cp -p /etc/osbuild-composer/repositories/rhel-90.json{,.bak}

sed -i -e 's|cdn.redhat.com/content/dist/rhel9|cdn.redhat.com/content/beta/rhel9|' \
/etc/osbuild-composer/repositories/rhel-90.json

systemctl restart osbuild-worker@.service.d osbuild-worker@1.service osbuild-composer.service
