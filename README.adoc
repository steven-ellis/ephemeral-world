= Ephemeral World Demo Scripts

This repository is for setup guides and scripts for my presentation on
Ephemeral environments using Image Builder and https://buildah.io/[buildah].

This demo and talk leverage these operating systems

* https://fedoraproject.org[Fedora 35]
* https://redhat.com[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9] *_Beta_*

In line with the talks focus on ephemeral environments we'll leverage cloud ready
images for the OS than can be rapidly configured via Ansible to demo the
key technologies.

== Deployment of Cloud / Virt ready OS Images

If you're running this demo code on a cloud hosted environment then simply select their pre-configured
cloud ready image, and skip to the setup of the demo tooling using Ansible below.

These instructions are for when you're running this locally under KVM + Libvirt.

Validated Images

* rhel-baseos-9.0-beta-0-x86_64-kvm.qcow2 
* Fedora-Cloud-Base-35-1.2.x86_64.qcow2
